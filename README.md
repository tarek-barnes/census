DBA.ipynb -- Simplistic data hygiene work and trivial modeling to narrow down models to optimize. I also look at reducing / prioritizing features w/ RFE.

Clustering.ipynb -- Attempt to impute missing "Workclass" values with KMeans clustering & TSNE. Rather unsuccessful.

Census_Analysis.ipynb -- Majority of analysis and modeling. Built a modular process for optimizing and diagnosing model variations, exploration with Keras.

Visualization.ipynb -- Put together visualizations via Bokeh and Seaborn.
